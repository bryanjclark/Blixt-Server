Blixt-Server
============

A python-based system to send push notifications from an App.net stream to APNS via Amazon Web Services.

Currently, I am able to get this python script running in my Terminal, but I'm stuck on how to bundle it up and push it to Elastic Beanstalk. I hear that the way to go might be to put it in a Flask app?

If you've got experience working with python and Amazon AWS, please let me know! This is the last hurdle to getting push notifications working for our app - and I'm new to Python. :)
